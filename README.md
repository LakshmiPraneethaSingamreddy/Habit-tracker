# 🌱 30-Day Habit Tracker

#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/-Z4DsEYuX14

#### Description:
The **30-Day Habit Tracker** is a simple, interactive web-based application designed to help users build and maintain daily habits over a fixed 30-day period. The goal of this project is to provide a clean, intuitive interface that allows users to visually track their habit completion, customize habit colors, and manage their habits entirely on the client side without requiring a backend server.

This project was created as a lightweight frontend application using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with **Bootstrap** used to simplify layout and responsiveness. The tracker focuses on usability, clarity, and visual feedback, ensuring that users can easily understand their progress at a glance. Each habit is displayed as a row in a table, while each column represents a day of the month. Clicking on a cell toggles the completion state for that habit on that specific day.

One of the key design goals of this project was to keep the logic simple while still offering meaningful interactivity. Users can add habits dynamically, assign each habit a unique color of their choice using a full color palette, and change that color even after the habit has been created. This flexibility improves user experience without significantly increasing technical complexity.

### Project Structure and Files
The project consists of three primary files, along with an optional assets folder:
- **index.html**
- **styles.css**
- **script.js**
- **assets/background.jpg**

Each file plays a specific role in the overall functionality and appearance of the application.

### index.html

The "index.html" file provides the structure of the application. It defines the layout using semantic HTML elements and Bootstrap classes. The main components include:
- A heading that displays the project title.
- An input section where users can:
  - Enter a habit name.
  - Choose a color using a color picker.
  - Add the habit using a button.
- A responsive table that displays:
  - Habit names.
  - Thirty columns representing days.
  - An actions column for editing and deleting habits.

The HTML file does not contain any application logic. Instead, it acts as a clean and minimal container for dynamic content generated by JavaScript. Bootstrap is included via a CDN to simplify spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.

### styles.css
The "styles.css" file is responsible for all custom styling beyond what Bootstrap provides. This includes:
- Applying a background image to the page to improve visual appeal.
- Styling habit cells to look clickable and interactive.
- Adding hover effects to cells to indicate interactivity.
- Making habit cells square with rounded corners for a clean UI.
- Styling the card container with a semi-transparent background to ensure readability over the background image.

Special attention was given to background styling. The `background-size: contain` property was chosen to ensure that the background image is visible across different screen sizes without distortion. While `cover` would normally be preferred, testing revealed that `contain` produced more consistent results across devices for this specific image.

### script.js
The "script.js" file contains all application logic and is the core of the project. It handles:
- Creating habit objects.
- Rendering the habit table dynamically.
- Handling user interactions such as clicking cells, changing colors, and deleting habits.
- Saving and loading habit data using "localStorage".

Each habit is stored as a JavaScript object containing:
- A unique ID.
- The habit name.
- The selected color.
- An array of 30 boolean values representing daily completion.
When a user clicks on a cell, the corresponding value in the habit’s progress array is toggled. The table is then re-rendered to reflect the updated state. This approach ensures the UI always stays in sync with the underlying data.
To preserve user progress, the project uses **localStorage**. Habit data is automatically saved whenever a change occurs and reloaded when the page is refreshed. This allows users to close and reopen the browser without losing their data, while keeping the project fully client-side.

### Design Decisions
Several design decisions were made intentionally:
- **30-day fixed structure:**  
  The tracker uses a fixed 30-day format to keep the UI simple and avoid complications with varying month lengths.
- **Client-side only:**  
  No backend was used to keep the project lightweight and easy to deploy on GitHub Pages.
- **Color-per-habit model:**  
  Each habit has a single color to provide consistent visual identification across days.
- **Re-rendering approach:**  
  Instead of updating individual cells manually, the table is re-rendered whenever data changes. This improves reliability and reduces bugs.

---

### Limitations and Future Improvements
This project intentionally avoids advanced features such as user accounts or cloud storage. As a result:
- Data is stored per browser and device.
- There is no cross-device synchronization.

**Potential future improvements include**:
- Month selection (28–31 days).
- Habit streak tracking.
- Data export and import.
- Dark mode.
- Cloud-based persistence using Firebase or Supabase.

### Conclusion
The 30-Day Habit Tracker demonstrates how a meaningful, interactive application can be built using core web technologies without unnecessary complexity. The project emphasizes clean design, usability, and maintainable code, making it both a practical habit-tracking tool and a solid demonstration of frontend development fundamentals.
